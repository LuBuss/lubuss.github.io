  With over ten years of software engineering experience and a background in business management, I’m a problem solver who excels at tackling
  complex projects while prioritizing stakeholder values. Collaboration is central to my approach, embracing diverse team input during project 
  planning. I advocate for agile systems engineering principles and firmly believe in overcoming challenges through resourceful solutions. My 
  leadership style adapts to the situation, often leaning towards transformational, delegate, and coaching styles to foster growth. As an 
  ambivert, I seamlessly transition between introverted contemplation and extroverted communication. With prior business management experience,
  I offer a well-rounded perspective on every project.
